# breast_cancer

This repo holds the processed data, modeling code, and figures for my thesis on ecological modeling of endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer. It applies the logistic and Lotka-Volterra competition models of population growth from classic ecological theory (see e.g. the Gotelli _Primer of Ecology_).
