# Modeling _in-vitro_ breast cancer data with ecological models using Stan

This repository holds the processed data, modeling code, and figures for my 
thesis on ecological modeling of endocrine therapy resistance in breast 
cancer. It applies the logistic and Lotka-Volterra competition models of 
population growth from classic ecological theory (see e.g. Gotelli's _Primer 
of Ecology_). The Stan code is deeply inspired by Bob Carpenter's [case study 
on ODEs in Stan using Lotka-Volterra 
dynamics](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/lotka-volterra-predator-prey.html#coding-the-model-stan-program).

The code for the image processing pipeline described in the paper, guidance on 
how to run the code, and documentation of the methods used are described in 
the `image_processing` directory of this repository. These details are 
provided both in a directory-specific readme as well as in the methods section 
of the associated paper. If you have additional questions, please contact 
Zachary Susswein.
